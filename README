=== Synopsis ===
This repository contains the reference data of Grid5000. The raw data is located in the "data" directory. You may change or add files by hand, but you could also use a specific generator called "grid5000.rb", which is available in the "generators" directory. Given one or more input files that describe (using the Ruby language) the data you want to add, it will generate the raw json files, directories and hard links needed.

=== Getting started ===
Right now, the easiest way to get started is to look at some existing input files in the "generators/input" directory. There you can see how you can define sites, clusters, nodes and environments programmatically. Then you can create a new file or change an existing one and run it in simulation mode:
  $ ruby grid5000.rb input/*.rb -s
Your changes won't be applied but you'll see what would have been changed. Thus, the simulation mode is useful to review your changes before committing and check the ruby syntax of the input files.

Run the "grid5000.rb" script (in /generators) without options ($ ruby grid5000.rb) to see how to use it.

=== Apply your changes to the master repository ===
After each modification to the repository, you should immediately commit your changes with a meaningful message, so that people can easily understand what has changed. Your commits should also be site-specific, or even cluster-specific to avoid merge conflicts. Try to avoid putting a lot of changes in only one commit.

Since users will make queries such as: "give me the description of that site at this date", the time between the date of the commit and the effective replication of the changes to the APIs must be as low as possible. 
That's why, right after your commit, you should push your changes to the remote master repository. Please not that commits whose committed date is older than 60 seconds will be rejected (please check that your system clock is correctly synchronized with a time server). Modifications are replicated every minute to the APIs.
